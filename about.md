I'm a DevOps Engineer at [hedgehog lab](https://www.hedgehoglab.com/) building cloud-based systems, helping the team solve interesting engineering problems and ensuring the smooth delivery of projects for our clients.

I've transformed the way we approach infrastructure, adopting an infrastructure-as-code approach where we leverage CloudFormation in conjunction with Python & Bash scripts to reliably provision our cloud environments, using the same approaches we apply to code across the organisation.

The best type of process is one completely automated by code. This is best embodied by the Docker-based CICD systems for the 4 platforms we use (Android, iOS, Python & React) and continue to improve upon.

## Consulting

I've helped [Wriggle Security](https://www.wrigglesecurity.co.uk/) launch their cyber security business in the North East of England. I provided security testing training to their employees and conducted several audits for their clients.

## Previous Work

At Koios Technology I lead & architected the development of [Ocucon](https://ocucon.com/), the worlds first cloud-based Video-Surveillance-as-a-Service solution. 

## University 

I graduated with first class honours in Computer Security at Northumbria University, winning the Accenture Prize for best student on the course. 

My dissertation was the development of a multi-factor authentication system using a fingerprint biometric device. You can find the source code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/JoeAlamo), [here](https://github.com/JoeAlamo/BiometricAuthSite) and [here](https://github.com/JoeAlamo/Arduino).

My final solution performed a cryptographic authentication protocol over HTTP using less than 2 kilobytes of RAM!

## Interests

I'm a big fan of hip-hop, discovering music and collecting records whenever I'm travelling.

For the past couple of years I've been getting into fitness, weight training and healthy cooking.

I'm also fascinated by cryptocurrencies, the technology behind them and the underlying security claims.

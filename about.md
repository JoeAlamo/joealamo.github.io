I'm a DevOps Engineer at [hedgehog lab](https://www.hedgehoglab.com/) building cloud-based systems, helping the team solve interesting engineering problems and ensuring the smooth delivery of projects for our clients.

I've transformed the way we approach infrastructure, adopting an infrastructure-as-code approach where we leverage CloudFormation in conjunction with Python & Bash scripts to reliably provision our cloud environments, using the same approaches we apply to code across the organisation.

The best type of process is one completely automated by code. This is best embodied by the Docker-based CICD systems for the 4 platforms we use (Android, iOS, Python & React) and continue to improve upon.

## Consulting

When possible, I enjoy and am open to provide consulting to add value to companies. In the past, I've helped [Wriggle Security](https://www.wrigglesecurity.co.uk/) launch their cyber security business in the North East of England by establishing their business offerings, providing security testing training to their employees and conducting penetration tests for their clients.

## Previous Work

In the past I've worked at Koios Technology to lead & architect the development of [Ocucon](https://ocucon.com/), a cloud-based innovative CCTV storage & access solution. 

## University 

I graduated with first class honours in Computer Security at Northumbria University, winning the Accenture Prize for best student on the course. My dissertation was the development of a multi-factor authentication system using a fingerprint biometric device. You can find the source code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/JoeAlamo), [here](https://github.com/JoeAlamo/BiometricAuthSite) and [here](https://github.com/JoeAlamo/Arduino).

## Interests

I'm a big fan of hip-hop, discovering other music and collecting records whenever I'm travelling.

For the past couple of years I've been getting into fitness, weight training and healthy cooking.

I'm also fascinated by cryptocurrencies, the technology behind them and the underlying security claims.

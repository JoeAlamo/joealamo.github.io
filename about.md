I'm a Senior DevOps Engineer at [One Utility Bill](https://oneutilitybill.co) helping the team to make everything utility bills related hassle-free for our customers.

We're heavy on automation, partner-to-partner APIs and seamless user-focused web experiences.

At this fast-moving & quickly growing startup I work closely with the CTO & Head of Development to ensure our development capabilities are industry leading and that we are setup for continued growth and success.

## Previous Work

At hedgehog lab I headed the DevOps transformation for a high-growth global agency working on projects for Deliveroo, GoCity, Kodak, and Clever Clinic. My main focus was our development practices, cloud infrastructure and automated CICD systems.

At Koios Technology I led & architected the development of [Ocucon](https://ocucon.com/), the worlds first cloud-based Video-Surveillance-as-a-Service solution. 

## Consulting

I've helped [Wriggle Security](https://www.wrigglesecurity.co.uk/) launch their cyber security business in the North East of England. I provided security testing training to their employees, conducted several audits for their clients and developed proof-of-concept demos with physical pentesting tools.

## University 

I graduated with first class honours in Computer Security at Northumbria University, winning the Accenture Prize for best student on the course. 

My dissertation was the development of a multi-factor authentication system using a fingerprint biometric device. You can find the source code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/JoeAlamo), [here](https://github.com/JoeAlamo/BiometricAuthSite) and [here](https://github.com/JoeAlamo/Arduino).

My final solution performed a cryptographic authentication protocol over HTTP using less than 2 kilobytes of RAM!

## Interests

I'm a big fan of hip-hop, discovering music and collecting records whenever I'm travelling.

For the past couple of years I've been getting into fitness, weight training and healthy cooking.

I'm also fascinated by cryptocurrencies, the technology behind them and the underlying security claims.

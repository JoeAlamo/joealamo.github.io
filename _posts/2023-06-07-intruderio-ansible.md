Running external vulnerability scanners against your infrastructure is a great way of bolstering your security ðŸ”’

Whilst working at One Utility Bill, I came across and adopted [Intruder.io](https://intruder.io). 

I've really enjoyed their product, offering regularly scheduled scans and emergency scans whenever new CVEs are disclosed.

To make life easier whenever provisioning new servers, I produced an Ansible role to automate the enrollment and scanning of new servers.

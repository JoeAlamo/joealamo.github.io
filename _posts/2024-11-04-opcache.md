There are 4 main takeaways for me from this recent experience:

 - Be aware of your cognitive biases - in this case Recency Bias
 - Reassess your foundations - just because something has been like that forever, doesn't mean it is correct
 - Follow the data - sometimes the data doesn't make sense because your assumptions are wrong
 - Never underestimate the power of turning things off & back on again!

This is the story of how a routine database upgrade triggered a brief 20 hour performance boost and how we eventually got to the bottom of it!

I'm very happy that we came across this and our apps are now 3x faster, using 10x less CPU, and saving hundreds of days in loading time for our users.
